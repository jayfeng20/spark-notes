Part of the power of Spark SQL comes from the wide range of DataFrame operations
(also known as untyped Dataset operations) it supports. The list of operations is quite
extensive and includes:

• Aggregate functions
• Collection functions
• Datetime functions
• Math functions
• Miscellaneous functions
• Non-aggregate functions
• Sorting functions
• String functions
• UDF functions
• Window functions
