As part of the DAG nodes, stages are created based on what operations can be per‐ formed serially or in parallel (Figure 2-4). Not all Spark operations can happen in a single stage, so they may be divided into multiple stages. Often stages are delineated on the operator’s computation boundaries, where they dictate data transfer among [[Spark executors]].![[Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.19.17 AM.png]]
