With Apache Spark 3.0, Pandas UDFs infer the Pandas UDF type from Python
type hints in Pandas UDFs such as pandas.Series, pandas.DataFrame, Tuple,
and Iterator. Previously you needed to manually define and specify each Pan‚Äê
das UDF type. Currently, the supported cases of Python type hints in Pandas
UDFs are Series to Series, Iterator of Series to Iterator of Series, Iterator of Multiple Series to Iterator of Series, and Series to Scalar (a single value).
