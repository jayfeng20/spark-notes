#spark-sql 

Spark manages both the metadata and the data in the file store.
- This could be a local filesystem, HDFS, or an object store such as Amazon S3 or Azure Blob
- a SQL command such as `DROP TABLE table_name` deletes <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">both the metadata and the data</mark>
