As shown in Figure 1-3, Spark offers four distinct components as libraries for diverse workloads: Spark SQL, Spark MLlib, Spark Structured Streaming, and GraphX. Each of these components is separate from Sparkâ€™s core fault-tolerant engine, in that you use APIs to write your Spark application and Spark converts this into a DAG that is executed by the core engine.
